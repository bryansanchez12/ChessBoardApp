# ChessBoardApp
Android application that emulates a chessboard. It connects with a piserver that is controlling a physical chessboard. So, a player can move a piece either from the physical board or from the digital board on the mobile phone and play like a normal chess. 

This allows the end-user to play with a real chessboard at home while the opponent can play remotely and still have a great match.
